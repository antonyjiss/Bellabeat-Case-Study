## Introduction
I work for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, as part of the marketing analysis team. Our Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen, is a firm believer in the potential of smart device fitness data to unlock new growth opportunities for our company.

To this end, we decided to analyze data from a competitor's (FitBit) device to gain insight into how consumers use smart devices. Using these insights, we aim to apply them to improve the performance of our own products. As part of this process, I was tasked with analyzing Fitbit data and presenting my findings and recommendations to the team.

My goal is to identify opportunities to improve one of Bellabeat's products using the insights gained from the analysis of competitor's data. By leveraging the data, we hope to enhance our product offerings and better meet the needs of our customers.

### Case Study Strategy
As I embark on the Google Data Analyst Course, I will utilize a comprehensive six-step data analysis process to accomplish the goal of this case study. The process begins with posing the right questions (Ask), followed by gathering data and ensure it is ready for analysis (Prepare), then cleaning relevant data and using statistical and computational methods to derive valuable insights (Process). The main part is, analyzing the processed data to uncover patterns, trends, and other valuable insights (Analyze). Once the data is analyzed, I will share my findings and insights with stakeholders (Share) and identify actionable steps to achieve the desired outcome (Act).
